## Good code
	Map material

## Bad Code
Taking into consideration my minimal previous knowledge of Unity, and our ambitious project scope. It is not suprising to me that quite a bit of bad code was created in an attempt to make deadlines. Overall i am not happy with the map generation part of hte program, but it works most as intended. However for object generation this is a diffrent story. <br>

	MoveObject
		Brute force
	Load from binary

## Reflection
**What have i learned**<br>During this project i have learned a lot about game devlopment. Aside from learning about untiy and C#, i have learned a lot about the process itself. My first lesson was defintly to lower my excpectations, and set more realistic goals. As a group, we came into the project with very grand plans, and we learned quickly that they would likely be impossible. Mostly due to lack of time, because of other demanding projects, but also from lack of knowledge about Unity and the language. <br><br>When it comes to Unit it felt like i was learning new features and built in systems at every turn. Coming from developing in mostly C++ and golang, this was quite a steep curve. However, as we progressed further into the project and i became more familiar with both C# and Unity, it went a lot smoother. Im very interested in trying to develop a game with unity again, as this was defintly the most enjoyable project i have done so far. However, i would probably give myself more time and headspace than i had this semester.<br>
**What could be done better**<br>For me my biggest regret and lesson, is to not rely on other peoples code for a foundation, and rather construct my own from scratch. As mentioned in the [[Lisence note]], i ended up significantly changing the code. However, since the foundation was built with a different intent, i could never get it to become mine or what i wanted. This just made me frustrated when trying to alter anything, and finding that the code had some hidden intricacies that made it break or change in unrelated places. Bottom line is that with the knowledge i have about C# after this project, i feel like i couldve done a better job than the resulting product.<br><br>Another point that couldve been done better, were assets. Since i was mostly working with the automatic generation aspect of the program, i didn't focus on the asset part. By the time the MVP came around we only had two actual textures, grass and trees. This is what lead to the homely houses, and later bushes as well as the item shop. We should've probably split tasks better, and begun searching for assets early on. However, as most of our members were more inclined to work on the code, the substandard assets fell on the backburner and were simply tolerated. This is defintly something i will carry on to my next game developing project. 

**Teamwork**
As for teamwork i feel like we have done well. With mostly consistent meetings
