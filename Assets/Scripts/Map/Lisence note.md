The included lisence is due to significant portions of the original map generation script being built upon Sebastian Lague's script.
We chose to use this as a foundaiton for our own map generation method since we had expirience working with it since before development.
Had we not utlized his script we wouldve in all likelyhood ended up with a strikingly similar method regardless, due to bias.

Nonetheless, we have altered, reworked and added to this script to the point of being able to call it our own. Additionally, we passed it by the lecturers, and it 
didnt seem to be an issue as long as we made significant alteration, which we have. Regardless, if this somehow becomes a problem, 
then have it known that Axel Jacobsen was responsible for developing map generation.

Signed, Axel Jacobsen.
